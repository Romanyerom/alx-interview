Explanation

    Transposing the Matrix:
        Swap elements at position (i, j) with (j, i). This operation swaps the rows with columns.
        The nested loops ensure that you only swap each pair once.

    Reversing Each Row:
        After transposing, reverse each row to get the final rotated matrix.
